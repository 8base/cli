# 8base CLI  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/8base/cli.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/8base/cli)

[**Sign Up for 8Base**](https://app.8base.com)	ðŸ¤˜	[**Documentation Home**](https://docs.8base.com)	ðŸ“‘	[**Getting Started**](https://docs.8base.com/projects/backend/getting-started)	ðŸš€	[**8base Plans**](https://www.8base.com/pricing)

The 8base Command Line Interface (CLI) makes it easy to generate custom functions and manage workspaces straight from the terminal.

We recommend that all developers regularly checkout the [8base Community](https://community.8base.com) forum for regular updates and changes being made to the 8base-cli package.

## Installation
The easiest way to install 8base-cli is to use NPM and install the package globally:

```shell
$ npm install -g 8base-cli
```

or, if you are using Yarn:

```shell
$ yarn global add 8base-cli
```

## Getting Started
Before using 8base-cli, you need to authenticate yourself. You can do this one of two ways:

Launching a browser using:

```shell
$ 8base login
```

or, through the CLI using:

```shell
$ 8base login --email="my@email.com" --password="myP@ssw0rd"
```

Once successfully authenticated, a file will be updated at `~/.8baserc` with a JSON payload for the authenticated session.

## Further Information
For more information about commands and configuration options, please refer the [8base CLI documentation](https://docs.8base.com/projects/backend/development-tools/cli). You can also learn about the different commands from the CLI by running `--help` with the package itself, or a given command.

## Contributing
Like most great things, the 8base CLI is a work in progress. As a consequence of that, the CLI is constantly improving. Our CLI is public and open-sourced right here on GitHub. So whenever you want to, you could:

1. Reporting an Issue
8base uses GitHub Issue Tracking to track issues (primarily bugs and contributions of new code). If you've found a bug, this is the place to start.

2. Fix an Issue
If you've not only found a problem in the CLI but also worked out the solution, please submit a pull request!

3. Add Features:
You can help improve the 8base CLI by adding awesome features. It's honestly an open-book. If you think something is useful, others probably will too.

We'll do our best to review, respond, and merge all contributions in a timely manner!
